illustrating $\tau = d\mathbf{L}/dt$.
block of mass $m$ slides along $x$ axis with velocity $\mathbf{v} = v\hat{\mathbf{i}}$.

$$\mathbf{L}_b = m\mathbf{r}_B\times\mathbf{v}$$
$$ = mlv\mathbf{\hat{k}}$$
if the block is sliding freely, $\mathbf{v}$ is constant and therefore, $\mathbf{L}_b$ is also constant.

now, suppose the block slows due to friction force $\mathbf{f} = -f\hat{\mathbf{i}}$.
$$\tau_b = \mathbf{r}_b\times\mathbf{f}$$$$ = -lf{\mathbf{\hat{k}}}$$.
so as the block slows, the direction of $\mathbf{L}_b$ stays the same but the magnitude decreases. So, $\Delta\mathbf{L}_b$ points in the negative $z$ direction. \

The direction of $\Delta\mathbf{L}_b$ is the same direction as $\tau_b$. since $\tau = d\mathbf{L}/dt$, the vectors $\tau$ and $\Delta\mathbf{L}$ will always be parallel.

from $\Delta\mathbf{L}_B = ml\Delta v \mathbf{\hat{k}}$:
$$\frac{d\mathbf{L}_b}{dt} = ml\frac{dv}{dt}\mathbf{\hat{k}}$$
and since $m dv/dt = -f$:
$$\frac{d\mathbf{L_B}}{dt} = -lf\mathbf{\hat{k}}$$the same origin must be used for both $\tau$ and $L$.
