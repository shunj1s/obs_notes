- for rotating systems, we add both a **centrifugal force** and a **Coriolis force**
- Earth itself is a rotating coordinate system!

## 9.5.1 Rate of Change of a Rotating Vector
consider any vector $\mathbf{B}$ rotating at rate $\Omega$ around an axis in direction $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$. The rotational velocity vector is $\Omega = \Omega\hat{\mathbf{n}}$.
