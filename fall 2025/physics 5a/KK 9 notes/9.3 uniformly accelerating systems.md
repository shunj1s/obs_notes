what about how physical laws appear to an observer in a system accelerating at rate $\mathbf{A}$ with respect to an inertial system?

$$\mathbf{a'} = \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{A}$$
where $\mathbf{A}$ is the acceleration of the primed system as measured in the inertial system.
Thus,
$$\mathbf{F'} = m\mathbf{a} - m\mathbf{A}$$
and since the unprimed system is inertial, $m\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{F}$ where $\mathbf{F}$ is the true force.
thus:
$$\mathbf{F'} = \mathbf{F} + \mathbf{F}_{fict}$$
where $\mathbf{F}_{fict} = -m\mathbf{A}$ and is called a **fictitious force**. it goes in the direction opposed to the direction of $\mathbf{A}$.

some examples:
	[[example - the apparent force of gravity]]
	[[example - cylinder on an accelerating plank]]
	[[example - pendulum in an accelerating car]]
