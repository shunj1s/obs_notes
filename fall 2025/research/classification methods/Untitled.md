## objective of classification:
The task takes many relatively small images of low resolution and varying mask levels. The classification should separate the images into two groups: good beam and bad beam. The bad beams are characterized by the following:
- Gaussian fit parameters outside the expected range
- Differential parameters outside the expected range
- High levels of noise
- Readout errors/glitches

Primary vector attempts:
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- Artificial Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks
