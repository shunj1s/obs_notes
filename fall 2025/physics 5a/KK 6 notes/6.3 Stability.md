Since $F = -dU/dx$, we can calculate force if we know $U$ 
	For a harmonic oscillator, $U = kx^2/2$ . Potential energy is a parabola.
	No matter which way the particle is displaced, the force points towards the origin $\rightarrow$ the system is **stable**.
when $dU/dx = 0$, the system is in equilibrium.
Equilibrium is stable if $d^2U/dx^2 > 0$.
	if <0, then a positive displacement would create a positive force (increases displacement)

Simplest example: pendulum of mass $m$ 
$$U(\theta) = mgz$$
$$ = mgl(1-\cos{\theta})$$
so when $\theta = 0$, the pendulum is in equilibrium.
While $\theta = \pi$ will also be stable, $d^2U/d\theta^2 = -mgl < 0$ $\rightarrow$ equilibrium is not stable.
