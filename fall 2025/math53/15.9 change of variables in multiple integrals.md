often, we use a substitution to simplify an integral ($u$ sub)
$$\int^b_a f(x)dx = \int_c^df(g(u))g'(u)du$$
where $x=g(u)$ and $a = g(c), b=g(d)$
or, 
$$\int_a^bf(x)dx = \int^d_cf(x(u))\frac{dx}{du}du$$
similarly, we can use a change of variable in double variables, like we do with polar coordinates
since $x=r\cos\theta$ and $y=r\sin{\theta}$, by the change of variables formula:
$$\iint_R f(x, y)dA = \iint_Sf(r\cos\theta, r\sin\theta)rdrd\theta$$
we consider a transformation $T$ from the $uv$-plane to the $xy$-plane:
$$T(u, v) = (x, y)$$
$$x = g(u, v)$$
$$y = h(u, v)$$
Assuming T is a $C^1$ transformation ($g$ and $h$ have continuous first order partial derivatives)
Ultimately, $T$ is just a function whose domain and range are subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$.
Thus, $T$ transforms $S$ into region $R$ in the $xy$ plane also called the image of S, consisting of the images of all points in $S$.

Thus, if $T$ is a transformation, there also exists a $T^{-1}$, where $u = G(x, y)$ and $v = H(x, y)$.

### example: basic transformation
$$x = u^2 - v^2$$
$$ y = 2uv$$
find the images of the square $S\{(u, v) | 0 \leq u \leq 1, 0 \leq v \leq 1\}$
	begin by finding the images of the sides of $S$.
$S_1$ is given by $v = 0$. thus, $x = u^2$, $y=0$, and goes $0\leq x\leq 1$.
For $S_2$ is $u = 1 (0\leq v\leq 1)$, thus:
$$x = 1-v^2\space y = 2v$$
we then eliminate $v$:
$$x = 1 - \frac{y^2}{4}\space 0\leq x \leq1$$
which is part of a parabola. $S_3$ is then:
$$ x = \frac{y^2}{4} - 1, -1\leq x \leq0$$
and $S_4$ is given by $u = 0$, $x = -v^2, y=0 | -1\leq x\leq 0$.

	so, how does this change in variables affect the double integral?\

$$\mathbf{r}(u, v) = g(u, v)\mathbf{i} + h(u, v)\mathbf{j}$$
where $\mathbf{r}(u, v)$ is the position vector of the image of the point $(u, v)$.
thus, the tangent vector at $(x_0, y_0)$ is represented by:
$$\mathbf{r}_u = g_u(u_0, v_0)\mathbf{i} + h_u(u_0, v_0)\mathbf{j} = \frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\mathbf{i} + \frac{\partial y}{\partial u}\mathbf{j}$$
and the tangent vector to the image curve where $u = u_0$:
$$\mathbf{r}_v = g(u_0, v_0)\mathbf{i} + h_v(u_0, v_0)\mathbf{j} = \frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\mathbf{i} + \frac{\partial y}{\partial v}\mathbf{j}$$
thus, we can approximate $R = T(s)$ by a parallelogram determined by secant vectors:
$$\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{r}(u + \Delta u, v_0) - r(u_0, v_0)\space \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{r}(u_0, v_0 + \Delta v) - \mathbf{r}(u_0, v_0)$$
taking the limit:
$$|(\Delta u \mathbf{r}_u) \times(\Delta v\mathbf{r}_v)| = |\mathbf{r}_u\times\mathbf{r}_v | \Delta u \Delta v$$
computing cross product:
"Jacobian" of the transformation $T$:
$$\frac{\partial(x, y)}{\partial(u, v)} = \begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial x}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} \\ \frac{\partial y}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial v}\end{bmatrix}| = \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} \frac{\partial y}{\partial v} - \frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\frac{\partial y}{\partial u}$$
Thus, $$\Delta A = |\frac{\partial(x, y)}{\partial(u, v)}|\Delta u \Delta v$$
suppose $T$ is a $C^1$ transformation whose Jacobian is nonzero and that $T$ maps a region $S$ in the $uv$ plane onto a region $R$ in the $xy$ plane. Suppose that $f$ is continuous on $R$ and that $R$ and $S$ are type I or type II plane regions.
Then:
$$\iint f(x, y)dA = \iint f(x(u, v), y(u, v)) |\frac{\partial(x, y)}{\partial(u, v)}|dudv$$
thus, $$dA = |\frac{\partial(x, y)}{\partial(u, v)}|du\space dv $$
