two balls of masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ with $m_2 = 3m_1$.
before the collision, the balls have equal and opposite velocities $\mathbf{v}$.
we are looking for the final velocities.

momentum
$$m_1\mathbf{v}_1 + m_2\mathbf{v}_2 = m_1\mathbf{v'}_1 + m_2\mathbf{v'}_2$$
energy
$$\frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2v_2^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_1{v'}_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2{v'}_2^2 + Q$$
using eq(1)
$${v'}_1 = -2v - 3{v'}_2$$
and then inserting this in equation 2:
$$4v^2 = (-2v - 3v'_2)^2 + 3{v'}_2^2$$
$$ = 4v^2 + 12v{v'}_2 + 12{v'}_2^2$$
$$ 0 = 12v{v'}_2 + 12{v'}_2^2$$
there are two solutions: $v'_2 = -v$ and $v'_2 = 0$.
solution 1:
	$v'_1 = v$
	$v'_2 = -v$
this solution restates the initial conditions, where the particles miss each other.

solution 2:
	$v'_1 = -2v$
	$v'_2 = 0$
in this solution, $m_1$ moves to the left with twice its original speed, and $m_2$ is at rest.
