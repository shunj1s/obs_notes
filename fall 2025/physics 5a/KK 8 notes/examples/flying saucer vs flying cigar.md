although $\mathbf{L}$ is conserved for torque-free motion, kinetic energy of rotation can change if the body is not absolutely rigid
	if the satellite rotates off the symmetry axis, the body experiences a time-varying centripetal acceleration, warping the satellite
thus, a cylindrical spacecraft will experience unstable motion--however, a thin disk spinning about its cylindrical axis will be far more stable
