a small weight of mass $m$ hangs from a string in an automobile accelerating at rate $A$. what is the static angle of the string from the vertical and the tension in the string?

In the laboratory system:
$$\begin{array}{c}T\cos\theta - W = 0 \\ T\sin\theta = mA \\ \tan\theta = \frac{mA}{W} = \frac{A}{g} \\ T = m\sqrt{g^2 + A^2}\end{array}$$

in the accelerating system:
$$\begin{array}{c}T\cos\theta - W = 0 \\ T\sin\theta - F_{fict} = 0 \\ F_{fict} = mA \\ \tan\theta = \frac{A}{g} \\ T = m\sqrt{g^2 + A^2}\end{array}$$
The fictitious force behaves like a constant gravitational force: it is constant and proportional to the mass.
