a problem that is difficult to solve in an inertial system, but trivial in an accelerating system!

considering a similar situation to [[example - the apparent force of gravity]], but now the car is at rest with the weight hanging vertically.

then, the car accelerates at rate A.

what is the maximum angle $\phi$ through which the weight swings?

A force of $mA$ is added towards the left. Thus, the bob behaves as a pendulum where "down" is not the true vertical, but rather at an angle $\phi_0 = \arctan(A/g)$.

Thus, the maximum angle of swing = $2\phi_0 = 2\arctan(A/g)$.
