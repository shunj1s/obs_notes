position defined by $r - \theta$ coordinates
$$r = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$$
$$\theta = \arctan(\frac{y}{x})$$
dealing with motion in two dimensions-- **plane polar coordinates**

lines of constant $\theta$ are straight lines, directed radially
lines of constant $r$ are circles concentric about the origin

generally:
$$\hat{\mathbf{r}}(\theta) = \cos{\theta}\hat{\mathbf{i}} + \sin{\theta}\hat{\mathbf{j}}$$
$$\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}(\theta) = -\sin{\theta}\hat{\mathbf{i}} + \cos{\theta}\hat{\mathbf{j}}$$
the directions of $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}$ vary with position, unlike $\hat{\mathbf{i}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{j}}$
