- A gyroscope is a flywheel spinning on an axle and a suspension that allows the axle to assume any orientation. 
![[Pasted image 20251021133046.png]]
- initially, the flywheel is brought up to speed at rate $\omega_x$
- if the gyroscope is released horizontally, the axis wobbles and then settles down to **uniform precession**.
	- the axle rotates around the vertical axis with velocity $\Omega$. 
- if the gyroscope is spinning rapidly, it begins to precess smoothly:
- If the axle is fixed in space, the angular momentum $\mathbf{L}_s$ comes solely from the spin of the flywheel
	- it is directed along the axle with magnitude $I_0\omega_s$, where $I_0$ is the $I$ of the flywheel around the axle
- For uniform precession, the orbital angular momentum is constant in magnitude and direction plays no dynamical role.
- $\mathbf{L}_s$ will always point along the axle and rotate with the gyroscope.
- If the angular velocity of precession is $\Omega$, then $$|\frac{d\mathbf{L}_s}{dt}| = \Omega L_s$$.
- thus, the direction of $d\mathbf{L}_s/dt$ is always tangential to the horizontal circle swept out by $\mathbf{L}_s$. thus:$$\tau = lW$$
- and is parallel to $d\mathbf{L}_s/dt$.
- using $|d\mathbf{L}_s/dt| = \tau$, we can find $\Omega$:
	- $$\Omega L_s = lW$$ $$\Omega = \frac{lW}{I_0\omega_s}$$
- This indicates that $\Omega$ increases as the flywheel slows

[[example - gyroscope precession]]

okay, so gyroscopes precess: but why?
- gyroscope precession seems unfamiliar when considered along Newotn's laws
- So, consider a rigid body consisting of tow particles of mass at either end of a rigid, massless rod of length $2l$. [[Pasted image 20251021134532.png]]
- The rod rotates in free space with angular momentum $\mathbf{L}_s$ along the $z$ direction.
- The speed of each mass is $v_0$. 
- **Show that applying torque $\tau$ will cause $\mathbf{L}_s$ to precess with angular velocity $\Omega = \tau/L_s$**

	Assume that the torque is applied during a short time $\Delta t$.
	The torque is due to two equal and opposite forces $F$--the total force is 0.
	However, the momentum of each mass:$$\Delta \mathbf{p} = m\Delta\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{F}\Delta t$$
	and since $\Delta \mathbf{v}$ is perpendicular to $\mathbf{v}_0$, the velocity changes direction:$$\Delta\phi\approx\frac{\Delta v}{v_0} = \frac{F\Delta t}{mv_0}$$
	The total torque is $\tau = 2Fl$, and $L_s= 2mv_0l$. $$\Delta\phi = \frac{F\Delta t}{mv_0}$$ $$ = \frac{2lF\Delta t}{2lmv_0}$$ $$= \frac{\tau\Delta t}{L_s}$$
	
	Since $\Omega = \Delta\phi/\Delta t$:
	$$ \Omega = \frac{\tau}{L_s}$$
