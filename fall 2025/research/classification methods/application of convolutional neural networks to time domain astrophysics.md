- variable stars exhibit changes in brightness
- time domain astronomy $\rightarrow$ determine astrophysical relationships
	- i.e. period luminosity relation
- regular, semiregular, and irregular variables
- organizing sequential data, treating it as a 2d image, and training a convolutional neural network on it
