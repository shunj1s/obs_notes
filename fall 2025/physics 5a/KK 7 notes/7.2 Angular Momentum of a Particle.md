$$\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times\mathbf{p}$$
where $\mathbf{L}$ is angular momentum for a particle with momentum $\mathbf{p}$ at position $\mathbf{r}$.
* $\mathbf{L}$ depends on the position vector $\mathbf{r}$, thus it depends on its location with respect to the origin of a coordinate system.
	* one must ALWAYS identify the coordinate system.
* involves the cross product $\rightarrow$ use right hand rule to find direction

### example : angular momentum of a sliding block
block of mass $m$ slides in $x$ direction with velocity $v\hat{\mathbf{i}}$. what is the angular momentum $\mathbf{L}_A$ around origin $A$ and angular momentum $\mathbf{L}_B$ around origin $B$?

![[Pasted image 20251013172759.png]]

since $\mathbf{r}_A$ is parallel to $\mathbf{v}$, $\mathbf{L}_A = 0$
with origin $B$, we resolve $r_B$ into component $r_\parallel$ and $r_\perp$
Thus, $$\mathbf{L}_B = m\mathbf{r}_b\times\mathbf{v} = m(r_\parallel + r_\perp)\times\mathbf{v}$$
$r_\parallel\times\mathbf{v} = 0$ and $|r_\perp\times\mathbf{v}| = lv\hat{\mathbf{k}}$, so:
$$\mathbf{L}_b = mlv\hat{\mathbf{k}}$$
where $\mathbf{L}_B$ lies in the positive $z$ direction.

### example: angular momentum of conical pendulum
![[Pasted image 20251013173104.png]]

assume pendulum in steady circular motion with angular speed $\omega$. 

since velocity is tangential, $|\mathbf{P}| = Mv = Mr\omega$
$$\mathbf{L}_A = Mr^2\omega\hat{\mathbf{k}}$$

now, for origin $B$, position is constant but with added $r'$ where $|r'| = l$
$$|\mathbf{L}_B| = |r'\times p|$$
$$ = |r'||p| = l|p|$$
$$ = Mlr\omega$$
However, $\mathbf{L}_B$ is not constant. $\mathbf{L}_B$ swings around depending on the direction. However, $\mathbf{L}_{Bz}$ is constant.
