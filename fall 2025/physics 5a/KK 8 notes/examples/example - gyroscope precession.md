Consider a gyroscope with is axle at angle $\phi$ with the vertical. ![[Pasted image 20251021134131.png]]
in this case, $\mathbf{L}_s$ in the $x-y$ plane swings around in space, while the complement parallel to the axis $z$ remains constant.
Thus, the horizontal component = $L_s\sin\phi$. $$|d\mathbf{L}_s/dt| = \Omega L_s\sin\phi$$
the torque due to gravity is horizontal:
$$\tau = l\sin\phi W$$
Thus, $$\Omega L_s\sin\phi = l\sin\phi W$$
$$\omega = \frac{lW}{I_0\omega_s}$$
and the precessional velocity is **independent of $\phi$.**
