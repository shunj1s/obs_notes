**physical pendulum** in which the mass is an extended structure and the support is a rod

### 7.7.1 simple pendulum through a rotational lens
pivot point $a$. moment of inertia $I_a = Ml^2$. The tension is a radial force and exerts no torque--torque arrives from weight $W = Mg$ of the bob.
Thus, $\tau_a = -Wr_\perp = -Wl\sin\phi$. Using the small angle approximation:
$$\tau_a = I_a\alpha = I_a\ddot{\phi}$$
$$Wl\phi = I_a\ddot{\phi}$$
$$I_a\ddot{\phi} = -Wl\phi$$
$$\ddot{\phi} + \frac{Wl}{I_a}\phi=0$$
Using $I_0 = Ml^2$:
$$\ddot{\phi} + \frac{g}{l}\phi = 0$$
thus, a harmonic oscillator with frequency $\omega = \sqrt{g/l}$
Here, $\omega$ is not the angular speed but the angular frequency. The angular speed is $\dot{\phi}$.

Thus, generally, for small amplitudes $\phi_0$:
$$T\approx T_0(1+\phi_0^2/16)$$

### 7.7.2 the physical ("real") pendulum
looking at a real pendulum = swinging object of any shape. mass = $M$, center of mass is at distance $l$ from the pivot. Thus, $I_a \neq Ml^2$ but is rather dependent on the shape.
- regardless, the pendulum executes simple harmonic motion with frequency $\omega = \sqrt{Mgl/I_a}$.
radius of gyration $k$:
$$ k = \sqrt{\frac{I_0}{M}}$$
So,  a ring with radius R will have $k_{ring} = R$ and a disk will have $k_{disk} = \sqrt{1/2}R$.
This is important because by the parallel axis theorem:
$$I_a = I_0 + Ml^2$$
$$ = M(k^2 + l^2)$$
so that 
$$\omega = \sqrt{\frac{gl}{k^2 + l^2}}$$
thus, the simple pendulum corresponds to $k = 0$ and $\omega = \sqrt{g/l}$.
