a cylinder of mass $M$ and a radius $R$ rolls without slipping on a plank accelerated at rate $A$. find the acceleration of the cylinder.

thus, the equations are:
$$f - F_{fict} = Ma'$$
$$Rf = -I_0\alpha'$$
since the cylinder rolls without slipping, $\alpha'R = a'$.
Thus:
$$\begin{array}{c}Ma' = -I_0\frac{a'}{R^2} - F_{fict} \\ a' = -\frac{F_{fict}}{M = I_0/R^2}\end{array}$$
And since $I_0 = MR^2/2$ and $F_{fict} = MA$:
$$a' = -\frac{2}{3}A$$
$$a = A + a' = \frac{1}{3}A$$
