## 6.5.1 stages of a collision
![[Pasted image 20251013163916.png]]
a) each particle is essentially free
b) the momentum and energy change due to interaction forces
c) the particles move with new velocities and directions


if there are no external forces
$$\mathbf{P}_i = \mathbf{P}_f$$
and for a two-body collision, this becomes:
$$m_1\mathbf{v}_1 + m_2\mathbf{v}_2 = m_1\mathbf{v'}_1 + m_2\mathbf{v'}_2$$
the components of $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$ comprise six unknowns, so we need three more equations

## 6.5.2 elastic and inelastic equations

**elastic collision**: total kinetic energy is unchanged (interaction forces are conservative)
**inelastic collision**: KE is not conserved (i.e. the objects stick together after colliding)

$$K_i = K_f + Q$$where $Q$ is the amount of kinetic energy converted to another form (like heat)

thus
$$\frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2v_2^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_1{v'}_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2{v'}_2^2 + Q$$
there are also superelastic collisions where the internal energy of the system is converted to kinetic energy

## 6.5.3 collisions in one dimension
if it's a two body collision where the particles move along a line, the final velocities are completely solvable via the above equations!

## 6.5.4 collisions and center of mass coordinates
related lecture notes: [[notes/fall 2025/physics 5a/lecture 11 10.2.25.md#^iUf4Y9VbAsuEAZpVEhcpt|lecture 10.2.25 - collisions in 3D]]

often, when treating three-dimensional collision problems we use the center of mass coordinate system.

if there are two particles with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ and velocity $v_1$ and $v_2$:
$$\mathbf{V} = \frac{m_1v_1 + m_2v_2}{m_1 + m_2}$$
$\mathbf{V}$ lies on the line joining $v_1$ and $v_2$:
![[Pasted image 20251013165840.png]]
thus, in the center of mass system:
$$v_{1c} = v_1 - \mathbf{V}$$
$$ = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}(v_1 - v_2)$$
$$v_{2c} = v_2 - \mathbf{V} = \frac{-m_1}{m_1 + m_2}(v_1 - v_2)$$
therefore, momentum:
$$\mathbf{P}_{1c} = m_1v_{1c}$$
$$ = \frac{m_1m_2}{m_1 + m_2}(v_1 - v_2)$$
$$ = \mu\mathbf{v}$$
where $\mu = m_1m_2/(m_1 + m_2)$ and represents the reduced math.
$$\mathbf{P}_{2c} = -\mu\mathbf{v}$$
The total momentum in the C system is therefore 0.
However, in the $L$ system:
$$m_1\mathbf{v_1} + m_2\mathbf{v_2} = (m_1 + m_2)\mathbf{V}$$
$v_{1c}$ and $v_{2c}$ determine the plane of scattering
	In the plane of scattering, each particle is deflected through angle $\mathbf{\Theta}$
$\mathbf{\Theta}$ is dependent on the interaction force, and vice versa

If we assume the collision is elastic, conservation energy is applied:
$$\frac{1}{2}v_{1c}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2c}^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1c}^2+\frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2c}^2$$
and since in the $C$ system, total momentum is zero:
$$m_1v_{1c} - m_2v_{2c} = 0$$
$$m_1v'_{1c} - m_2v'_{2c} = 0$$
Eliminating $v_{2c}$ and $v'_{2c}$ from the energy equation yields
$$\frac{1}{2}(m_1 + \frac{m_1^2}{m_2})v_{1c}^2 =\frac{1}{2}({m_1 + \frac{m_1^2}{m_2}}){v'}_{1c}^2$$
thus
$$v_1c = v'_1c$$
$$v_2c = v'_2c$$
so in $C$ frame, the velocity vectors merely rotate, but otherwise stay the same (relative to $\mathbf{V}$)
