sometimes in physics, we need both magnitude and direction to describe area (i.e. whether the plane is perpendicular or parallel to the flow)

thus, $A$ = base $\times$ height
		= $CD\sin{\theta}$
		= $|\mathbf{C}\times\mathbf{D}|$
$\mathbf{A} = |\mathbf{C}\times\mathbf{D}|$ will be normal to the plane with unit vector $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$.
