- pendulums were used to measure g
- Kater's pendulum:
	- two knife edges distances $l_A$ and $l_B$ from the center of mass.
Thus:
$$T_A = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{k^2 + l_A^2}{gl_A}}$$
$$T_B = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{k^2 + l_B^2}{gl_B}}$$
The pendulum is then adjusted such that the periods are identical. Thus, we can then solve for $k^2$:
$$k^2 = \frac{l_A l_B^2 - l_B l_A^2}{l_B - l_A}$$
$$k^2 = l_A l_B$$
thus:
$$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l_a l_B + (l_A)^2}{gl_A}}$$
and $$g = 4\pi^2(\frac{l_Al_B}{T^2})$$
