- Potential energy has a minimum at equilibrium, so bound systems oscillate like a harmonic oscillate
	- U parabolic shape
- Thus, we can produce a Taylor series for $U(x)$:
$$U(r) \approx U(r_0) + (r - r_0)\frac{dU}{dr}|_{r_0} + \frac{1}{2}(r-r_0)^2\frac{d^2 U}{dr^2}|_{r_0} + ...$$
and since $\frac{dU}{dr} = 0$ at $r_0$, and we can approximate:
$$U(r) \approx U(r_0) + \frac{1}{2}(r - r_0)^2\frac{d^2 U}{dr^2}|_{r_0}$$
For a harmonic oscillator:
$$U(x) = c + \frac{1}{2}k(x - x_0)^2$$
where c is constant.
Thus
$$ k = \frac{d^2 U}{dr^2}|_{r_0}$$
### example: molecular vibrations
masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ bound in diatomic molecule where their separation is always close to $r_0$. 
can be modeled by a spring with eq = $r_0$ and spring constant $k$.
how do we find vibration frequency?
$$m_1\ddot{r_1} = k(r - r_0)$$
$$m_2\ddot{r_2} = -k(r - r_0)$$
where $r = r_2 - r_1$
divide by $m_1$ and $m_2$ and subtract:
$$\ddot{r_2} - \ddot{r_1} = \ddot{r} = -k(\frac{1}{m_1} + \frac{1}{m_2})(r - r_0)$$
$$\ddot{r} = -\frac{k}{\mu}(r-r_0)$$
where $\mu = m_1 m_2 / (m_1 + m_2)$ and is called **reduced mass**
since $\omega = \sqrt{k / m}$
$$\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}} = \sqrt{\frac{d^2 U}{dr^2}|_{r_0}\frac{1}{\mu}}$$

### example: lennard-jones potential
potential energy function describing interactions between two atoms.
$$U = \epsilon[(\frac{r_0}{r})^{12} - 2(\frac{r_0}{r})^6]$$
when $r < r_0$, $(r_0/r)^{12}$ rises steeply, while $(r_0/r)^6$ decreases slowly for $r > r_0$.
thus, we can calculate the frequency of oscillations about equilibirum.
$$\frac{dU}{dr} = (\frac{\epsilon}{r_0})[(-12\frac{r_0}{r})^{13} + 12(\frac{r_0}{r})^7
)]$$
second derivative:
$$\frac{d^2 U}{r_0^2}[(12)(13)(\frac{r_0}{r})^1 4 - (12)(7)(\frac{r_0}{r})^8]$$
and since $k = \frac{d^2 U}{dr^2}|_{r_0}$,
$$ k = \frac{72\epsilon}{r_0^2}$$
thus:
$$\omega = 12\sqrt{\epsilon/r_0^2m}$$

### quadratic oscillations
* energy can be written in terms other than displacement:
	$$ U = \frac{1}{2}Aq^2 + c$$
	$$K = \frac{1}{2}B\dot{q}^2$$
	where q is any variable.
	Regardless,
$$ \omega = \sqrt{\frac{A}{B}}$$
see: [[proof of quadratic oscillation frequency]]
so, we can always find angular frequency of small oscillations!
