earth's angular momentum features two components
- orbital angular momentum (motion around the sun)
- spin angular momentum (rotational motion around polar axis)

since the earth is not fully spherical, we find there is actually a small torque on Earth, which causes the spin axis to slowly change directions $\rightarrow$ **precession of the equinoxes**

earth bulges slightly--equatorial radius is about 21km greater than its polar radius. thus, the gravitational force of the sun creates a torque.

in the winter solstice, the bulge above the ecliptic is nearer than the sun $\rightarrow$ torque on the earth is perpendicular.

in the summer solstice, the torque is stronger, but the same direction.

average torque is perpendicular to spin angular momentum.

as the spin axis precesses, the torque remains perpendicular, acting a bit like a gyroscope with a tilted axis (see [[example - gyroscope precession]])
