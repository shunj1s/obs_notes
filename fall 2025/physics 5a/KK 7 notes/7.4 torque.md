quantity "torque" designated by $\mathbf{\tau}$ is analogous to force in linear motion.
$$\mathbf{\tau} = \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{F}$$
like angular momentum, torque is derived from cross product, and similar methods can be applied.

naturally, $\tau$ and $\mathbf{F}$ are inherently different quantities.
- $\tau$ depends on the origin
- $\tau$ and $\mathbf{F}$ are mutually perpendicular--thus, there can be torque without force and vice versa. see: [[Pasted image 20251013181604.png | three scenarios of torque]]

## example: torque due to gravity
systems often have torque exerted by gravity. (i.e. pendulum)
the torque on a body around any point is $\mathbf{R}\times\mathbf{W}$, where $\mathbf{W}$ is the weight of the point.

So, how do we find the torque on a body of mass $M$ around origin $A$ when the applied force is due to uniform gravitational field $\mathbf{g}$?

$\rightarrow$ regard the body as a collection of particles!
$$\tau_j = \mathbf{r}_j\times m_j\mathbf{g}$$

where $\mathbf{r}_j$ is the position vector of the $j$th particle from origin $A$.. $m_j$ is its mass.
Thus:
$$\mathbf{\tau} = \sum_j \mathbf{\tau}_j$$
$$ = \sum_j \mathbf{r}_j \times m_j\mathbf{g}$$
$$ = (\sum_j m_j\mathbf{r}_j \times g)$$
since center of mass $\sigma m_j\mathbf{r}_j = M\mathbf{R}$,
$$\tau = M\mathbf{R}\times\mathbf{g} = \mathbf{R}\times M\mathbf{g}$$
## example: torque and force in equilibrium
for a system to be an equilibrium, net force and torque must be 0.
generally, the selected origin is a point where several forces act and these toqrues cancel out.

example: uniform rod of length $\pi R/2$ bent in the shape of a quadrant of radius $R$. 
![[Pasted image 20251013185153.png]]
the center of mass is at $\pi R/4$. For translational equilibrium, $N=W$, where $W$ is the weight acting at the center of mass. So, lets evaluate torque at the point where the quadrant rests on the ground.

$$\tau = Wl - AR$$ and is therefore 0 at equilibrium.
