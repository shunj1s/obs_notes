angular momentum can make a freely moving object stable!
- keeps a rolling hoop upright
- spin on a bullet
- throwing a frisbee!

so, why does it do this? let's look at a cylinder of mass $M$ moving parallel to the axis.
- the cylinder is not spinning along the axis
- a small force $F$ acts on the cylinder for time $\Delta t$
- $F$ is applied perpendicular to the axis at distance $l$ from the center of mass

The torque through the center of mass is $\tau = Fl$.
The angular impulse is $\tau\Delta t = Fl\Delta t$. 
Thus, $\Delta L_A = I_A(\omega - \omega_0) = Fl\Delta t$
if we assume $\omega_0 = 0$, then:
$$\omega = \frac{Fl\Delta t}{I_A}$$

now, consider the cylinder rapidly spinning around the long axis with angular momentum $\mathbf{L}_s$.
Torque along the horizontal axis causes precession around the vertical axis.
$$\Omega = \frac{Fl}{L_s}$$
and the angle through which it precesses:
$$\phi = \Omega\Delta t = \frac{Fl\Delta t}{L_s}$$
instead of just tumbling, the cylinder lowly changes orientation while the force is applied.
the faster the spin, the smaller $\phi$.
