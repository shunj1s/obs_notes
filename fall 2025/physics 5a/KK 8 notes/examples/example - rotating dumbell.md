- consider a dumbbell made of two uniform spheres, each of radius $b$ and mass $M$ separated by a thin massless rod
- distance = $2l$
- at a certain instant, the rod coincides with the $z$ axis $\rightarrow$ $\omega$ lies in the $y-z$ plane.

we can then use the tensor of inertia to find $\mathbf{L}$.
- since the body is symmetrical and aligned with the coordinate axes, the products of inertia vanish:
$$L_x = I_{xx}\omega_x$$
$$L_y = I_{yy}\omega_y$$
$$L_z = I_{zz}\omega_z$$
$I_{zz}$ is just the moment of inertia of two spheres $\rightarrow = \frac{4}{5}Mb^2$
Using the parallel axis theorem, we can find the moment of inertia raound the y axis:
$$I_{yy} = \frac{2}{5}Mb^2 + 2Ml^2$$
and since $\omega$ lies in the y-z plane, $\omega_x = 0 = L_x$.
$$L_y = I_{yy}\omega_y$$
$$L_z = I_{zz}\omega_z$$
$\mathbf{L}$ is not parallel to $\omega$.
