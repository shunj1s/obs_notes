using tangential velocity, radial velocity, and gravity

$\dot{r} = 0, \dot{\theta} = \omega =$ constant
thus, $\ddot{\theta} = 0$
$$\vec{a} = \hat{r}\omega^2 r = -\hat{r}\frac{v^2}{r}$$
since each bead experiences htis, there must be a force:
$\vec{F} = m\vec{a} = -m\hat{r}\frac{v^2}{r}$
what generates this force? the tension between the beads, creating a small force.
