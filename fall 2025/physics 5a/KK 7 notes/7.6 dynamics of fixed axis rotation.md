distinguishing between internal and external torques.
- observationally, we know internal torques add to zero and the angular momentum will never change

"pure rotation" - there is an axis of rotation at rest
$$L_c = I\omega$$
since $\tau = d\mathbf{L}/dt$:
$$\tau_z = \frac{d}{dt}(I\omega)$$
$$ = I\alpha$$
where $\alpha$ is known as the angular acceleration
to balance an axis such that $\alpha$ is 0, the pivot point must be at the center of mass
$$K = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$$
also analogous to linear K calculation

## example: massive atwood machine
find acceleration of $a$ for [[Pasted image 20251013204619.png|this arrangement]]
so, the equations of motion:
$$W_1 - T_1 = M_1 a$$
$$T_2 - W_2 = M_2 a$$
$$\tau = T_1 R - T_2 R = I\alpha$$
$$N - T_1 - T_2 - W_p = 0$$
$N$ is the force on the axle and doesn't matter.
like $v = \omega R$, $$a = \alpha R$$
thus:
$$W_1 - W_2 - (T_1 - T_2) = (M_1 + M_2)a$$
$$T_1 - T_2 = \frac{I\alpha}{R} = \frac{Ia}{R^2}$$
$$W_1 - W_2 - \frac{Ia}{R^2} = (M_1 + M_2)a$$


and thus, if the pulley is a simple uniform disk:
$$I = (M_p/2)R^2$$
and $$a = \frac{(M_1 - M_2)g}{M_1 + M_2 + M_p/2}$$
The pulley increases the total inertial mass of the system, but is functionally only one half of its real mass
