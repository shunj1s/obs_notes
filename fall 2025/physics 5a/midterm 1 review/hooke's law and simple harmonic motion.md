Force $F_s$ exerted by a spring is given by:
$$F_s = -k(x-x_0)$$
where $k$ is the spring constant and $x - x_0$ is the displacement of the spring from equilibrium position $x_0$. 

so, when spring is stretched, $x > x_0$ and $F_x$ is negative (directed towards $x_0$).
when $x < x_0$, $F_s$ is positive.
this creates simple harmonic motion.

For $F_s$:
$$M\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -kx$$
if $\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{M}}$,
$$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \omega^2 x = 0$$
any system that obeys an equation of this form is known as a **harmonic oscillator**, and the rest of their motion can be described as such:
$$x v= A\sin{\omega t} + B\cos{\omega t}$$
where A and B are constants, or:
$$x = C\sin{(\omega t + \phi)}$$
$\omega T = 2\pi$. $T$ is known as the period of the motion, and $\omega$ as the angular frequency.
