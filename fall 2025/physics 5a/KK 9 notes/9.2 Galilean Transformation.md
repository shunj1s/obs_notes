- fundamentally, any coordinate system moving uniformly with respect to an inertial reference frame is also inertial

- consider scientists A and B, each with different systems in different labs
- A and B both use the Cartesian coordinate system
- We assume that the systems have corresponding axes and are parallel

- position of mass $m$ is given by $r_A$ in system A and $r_B$ in system B
$$\mathbf{r}_B = \mathbf{r}_A - S$$
where $S$ is the displacement of the two systems.

If the mass accelerates in A at rate $\mathbf{a}_a = \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_a$, then A concludes there is a force on $m$ given by $\mathbf{F}_a = m\mathbf{a}_a$

similarly, B observes rate $\mathbf{a}_B$ as if acted on by force $\mathbf{F}_B$

so, what's the relationship between $\mathbf{F}_B$ and $\mathbf{F}_a$?
$$\mathbf{v}_\beta = \mathbf{v}_\alpha - \mathbf{V}$$
$$\mathbf{a}_\beta = \mathbf{a}_\alpha - \mathbf{A}$$
where $\mathbf{V} = \dot{\mathbf{S}}$ and $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{\dot{V}} = \ddot{\mathbf{S}}$

if $\mathbf{V}$ is constant, then the relative motion is uniform. $\mathbf{F}_\beta = \mathbf{F}_\alpha$.
So, this leads to an enigma: there's no way to distinguish one inertial system from another. This is then enigmatically countered by the existence of special relativity, but we don't care about that right now.
lets consider a point at $t=0$ such that $S = \mathbf{V}t$:
$$\mathbf{r}_\beta = \mathbf{r}_\alpha - \mathbf{V}_t$$
$$t_\beta = t_\alpha$$
This set of relations is known as a transformation: transforming coordinates from one coordinate system to another. When a transformation is done between two inertial systems, it is known as a **Galilean transformation**.
