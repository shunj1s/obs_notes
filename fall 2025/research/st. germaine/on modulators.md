what even are modulators?
	an electronic circuit that superimposes a low-frequency signal onto a high-frequency carrier signal for the purpose of wireless transmission.

thus, "thermal choppers" refers to devices that use thermal properties to modulate a beam.

on wikipedia: "chopping is a technique used with infrared telescopes to minimize interference from external or internal heat".

the chopper rocks the mirror in a telescope back and forth in rapid succession to measure background radiation

"chop reference" = reference recorded with the data during the modulation process and makes it easier to demodulate (?) perchance a question to be asked...
