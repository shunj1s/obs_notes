torque (like force) determines the rate of change in angular momentum
$$\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p})$$
$$ = (\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}\times\mathbf{p}) + (\mathbf{r}\times\frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}
)$$
since $(d\mathbf{r}/dt)\times\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{v}\times m\mathbf{v} = 0$, the first term vanishes (the vectors are parallel.)
$d\mathbf{p}/dt = \mathbf{F}$, so we end up with $\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{\tau}$ and thus:
$$\tau = \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt}$$

## 7.5.1 conservation of angular momentum
if torque is zero, $\mathbf{L}$ is constant momentum is conserved. 

### central force motion and the law of equal areas
- Kepler's law: orbits of planets are ellipses, and the area swept out by the radius vector from the sun to a planet in a given time is the same for any location of the planet in its orbit. see [[Pasted image 20251013194101.png|this image]]
- this law can be proven through considerations of angular momentum

Particle moving under force $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = f(r)\hat{\mathbf{r}}$. The torque, then, is $\tau = \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{F}(\mathbf(r)) = \mathbf{r}\times f(r)\hat{\mathbf{r}} = 0$.
therefore, $\mathbf{L}$ is conserved and constant in both magnitude and direction.

Consider time $t$ and $t + \Delta t$ where its polar coordinates are $(r, \theta)$ and $(r + \Delta r, \theta + \Delta \theta)$.
for small values of $\Delta\theta$ (i.e. $d\theta$), $\Delta A$ is approximately equal to a triangle with base $r + \Delta r$ and altitude $r\Delta\theta$.
$$\Delta A \approx \frac{1}{2}(r + \Delta r)(r\Delta\theta)$$
$$ = \frac{1}{2}r^2\Delta\theta + \frac{1}{2}r\Delta r \Delta\theta$$
and thus, the rate at which area is swept out:
$$\frac{dA}{dt} = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{\Delta A}{\Delta t}$$
$$ = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{2}(r^2\frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t} + r\frac{\Delta\theta\Delta r}{\Delta t})$$
$$ = \frac{1}{2}r^2\frac{d\theta}{dt}$$
Since angular momentum is conserved and the velocity of the particle in polar coordinates is $\mathbf{v} = \dot{r}\mathbf{\dot{r}} + \mathbf{r}\dot{\theta}\mathbf{\hat{\theta}}$:
$$\mathbf{L} = (\mathbf{r}\times m\mathbf{v}) = r\mathbf{\hat{r}}\times m(\dot{r}\mathbf{\hat{r}}\times r\dot{\theta}\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}) = mr^2\dot{\theta}\hat{\mathbf{k}}$$

Finally:
$$\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta = \frac{L_z}{2m}$$
And since $L_z$ is constant for any central force, $dA/dt$ will also be constant.
